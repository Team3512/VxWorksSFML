This is a record of the differences, and mainly problems, I faced while porting SFML2 to VxWorks 6.3 for FRC
- Tyler Veness, 2013 Software Lead, FRC Team 3512

WindRiver VxWorks doesn't support PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and other types
	therefore doesn't support all of POSIX threads
doesn't support wchar and wcslen among other wide character functions

had type conversion issues in sf::Socket and similar classes (wrong headers included?) b/c typedef from socketlen_t to int wasn't working
